## Features

- **Efficient Reduction**: Perform various reduction operations on ndarrays with minimal overhead.
- **Flexible Callback**: Use any function as a callback to customize the reduction process.
- **Strided Arrays**: Specifically designed for one-dimensional strided arrays.
- **JavaScript and Node.js Support**: Works seamlessly in both browser and Node.js environments.

## Installation

To install the package, use npm:

```bash
npm install ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-dispatch-by
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the constructor:

```javascript
const reduce = require('ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-dispatch-by');

// Define your callback function
const sum = (acc, value) => acc + value;

// Create an ndarray
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const arr = ndarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// Perform reduction
const result = reduce(arr, sum);
console.log(result); // Outputs: 15
```

## API Reference

### `reduce(ndarray, callback)`

- **Parameters**:
  - `ndarray`: The input ndarray.
  - `callback`: A function that takes two parameters: the accumulator and the current value.
  
- **Returns**: The result of the reduction operation.

## Examples

### Sum of Elements

```javascript
const sum = (acc, value) => acc + value;
const arr = ndarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
const result = reduce(arr, sum);
console.log(result); // Outputs: 15
```

### Product of Elements

```javascript
const product = (acc, value) => acc * value;
const arr = ndarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
const result = reduce(arr, product);
console.log(result); // Outputs: 120
```

### Custom Reduction

You can define your own reduction logic:

```javascript
const max = (acc, value) => (value > acc ? value : acc);
const arr = ndarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
const result = reduce(arr, max);
console.log(result); // Outputs: 5
```
